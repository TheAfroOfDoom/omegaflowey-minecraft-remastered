# NOTE: bullets start summoning _at_ exactly x0/z0, but likely won't finish summoning (their last column/row)
# at x.end / z.end we step using dx/dz and dx/dz likely doesn't evenly distribute into the grid's total width/length
# NOTE: x0/z0 are at e.g. -21.51 instead of -21.50 so that when we summon at something without a decimal (e.g. 3.0),
# Minecraft doesn't auto center the coordinate. if you set this to `-2150`, you'll see a non-uniform grid
