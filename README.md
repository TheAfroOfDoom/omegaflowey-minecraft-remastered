# Omega Flowey in Minecraft - Remastered

Back in early 2016 I released `Omega Flowey in Minecraft`.

- [original video](https://youtu.be/5Q8OkmrZom8)
- [original thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Undertale/comments/4a9jht/spoilers_omega_flowey_boss_fight_in_minecraft/)

Since then I've gained a lot of skills both in Minecraft map development and in programming generally. This repo will store any and everything relating to development of a remaster of the original map for modern Minecraft version(s) with better gameplay, performance, and visuals.

### Setup

---

<details>
  <summary><strong>Workspace</strong></summary>

1. Install [`Node.js >= 16.10`](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
2. Install [`Yarn 3.6.3`](https://v3.yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) by running `corepack enable`
3. Initialize the repo by running `yarn`
4. Copy-paste `.env.EXAMPLE` and rename it to `.env`

   1. Replace all the paths in your new `.env` with paths on your local machine -- e.g. replacing `afro` with `<YOUR_USERNAME>`.

   2. Replace `ASSETS_DIR` by following these steps:

      1. Extract a vanilla assets folder for Blockbench to use by following this [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/wdx9mk/how_do_i_find_the_assets_folder_in_minecraft/iikxx3d/)

         1. A typical `.minecraft` assets folder is found at `%appdata%/.minecraft/versions`

         2. You will need some form of file extraction software -- e.g. [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/)

         3. The file context to extract the `.jar` will look something like `7-Zip > Extract to "1.21\"`

      2. Set `ASSETS_DIR` to the path to your extracted version folder

         1. **Make sure to point to the doubly nested folder** -- e.g. `.../versions/1.21/1.21`

5. Run `yarn down` to extract the Minecraft world to your local Minecraft's `saves` directory (so you can open the world in-game)

  <summary><strong>Required Tools</strong></summary>

1. [Blockbench](https://www.blockbench.net/downloads) -- for 3D modelling
   - Install our Blockbench CLI plugin:
     - Open Blockbench, then go to `File > Plugins > Load Plugin From File` and select the `bb-cli.js` file from your local `omegaflowey-remastered` repo (`omegaflowey-remastered/package-scripts/modules/bb-cli.js`).
   - Install Animated Java from the Blockbench plugin store
     - see the [docs](https://animated-java.dev/docs/getting-started/installing-animated-java#installing-animated-java) for a detailed guide on how to do this.
   - Restart Blockbench after installing these plugins

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Recommended Tools (Optional)</strong></summary>

Install the following apps:

1. [paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/download.html) -- for image editing
2. [ScreenToGif](https://www.screentogif.com/) -- lightweight GIF recorder
3. [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/event/davinciresolvedownload) -- for video editing / frame-by-frame video analysis (of the original fight in Undertale)

We also recommend using [blockcolors.app](https://blockcolors.app/) to get a representative vanilla block texture for a desired color while texturing models.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Local Unit Testing (Optional)</strong></summary>

1. Download the [Fabric mod loader](https://fabricmc.net/) and install a new profile to your Minecraft launcher
2. Download the [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api/files) jar
3. Download the latest release jar of [`packtest`](https://modrinth.com/mod/packtest)
   1. You should probably download the same version that we're currently specifying in `./.github/workflows/datapack.yml`
4. Move the `Fabric API` and `packtest` jars into your `mods` folder in the Minecraft directory (typically `%appdata%/.minecraft/mods`)
5. Run the new profile in your Minecraft launcher to launch a (lightly) modded instance that's able to run `packtest`'s new commands designed for testing
   1. Try: `test runall`
   2. See `packtest`'s [README](https://github.com/misode/packtest) for full command documentation

### Development

#### Important scripts

Read the descriptions of the following scripts and run them when it is recommended to:

1. `yarn start export`: run the Animated Java (AJ) blueprint export script

   We recommend running `yarn start export` at least once, and every time changes to `.ajblueprint` files occur from new incoming commits.

   1. `yarn start export.force`

      Normally, `yarn start export` keeps track of what files have been exported on your local machine via each model's file hash.

      Sometimes this gets out of sync (for various, usually rare, reasons); in this case you can run `yarn start export.force` to have the auto-exporter forcibly re-export every model in the repository.

      This shouldn't be your default export script because it takes around a minute to run, but is completely safe to do if you're ever unconfident that your exported model files are correct.

2. `yarn start`: this keeps your local repository's content synced with your `.minecraft` directory -- datapack/resourcepack changes will reflect in-game

   We recommend keeping `yarn start` running at all times while working on the project.

3. `yarn down`: extracts the Minecraft world in the repo to your local Minecraft saves. This is important to run whenever there's changes to the world (see `yarn sync` above) or you want to hard-reset your world state, e.g. if you made any changes you want to discard.

4. `yarn sync`: zips your Minecraft world and copies it to the repo as (`world.zip`). This is how we handle version-control for the actual Minecraft world. This is especially important to run and commit if you make any _physical changes_ to the world like breaking/placing blocks.

5. `yarn lint`: runs Prettier, ESLint, and our custom linting rules on our files. Run this prior to pushing commits to save on our workflow hours.

#### Adding a new model/animation

1. Create a new Animated Java Rig via `File > New > Animated Java Blueprint`
2. Enter inputs for the following required fields:
   1. `Project Name`
   2. `Resource Pack`: select the `resourcepack` directory located at the root of the repository
   3. `Data Pack`: select the `datapacks/animated_java` directory starting from the root of the repository
3. Save the file with `CTRL + S` to somewhere appropriate under `resourcepack/assets/omega-flowey/models`
   1. **While the model is still a work-in-progress, append `_dev` to the filename so our auto-export scripts skip it**
      1. e.g. `housefly_dev.ajblueprint`
4. Export your model/animations by clicking `Animated Java > Export` at the top
5. When finished with the model, remove the `_dev` suffix from the filename (e.g. `housefly.ajblueprint`)
