1. randomly choose attack
2. if attack was one of last 2 attacks, try again
3. repeat 2
4. continue

# "1" gamemaker unit is 1/30 seconds?
# so 30 frames per second

# for phase 2/4 (save-states), its the above steps as:
[1,2,4], but for the last 1 attack

attacks
1 = lower eye bullet hell => adds random length += "0..30"
2 = upper eye bullet hell => adds random length += "0..25"
3 = homing vines => adds random length += "0..25"
- IF ATTACK LENGTH IS >=90 (random "20..25"), LASER SHOOTS (5/25)
4 = friendliness pellets
5 = bomb
6 = dentata snakes
7 = finger guns
8 = flies
9 = flamethrower

20 = homing-vine save-states
21 = x-bullets upper save states

22 = slow upper bullets
23 = slow lower bullets
for slow attacks, we don't retry if we repeat an attack

99 = laser
- laser attack can trigger during homing-vines after awhile(?)
  but only once per boss fight.
  its the first homing-vines attack only??
- laser happens "90" units after homing-vines starts. 3 SECONDS
  but then is set to "-999" units, functionally a cooldown(?)

phases
0 = 1, 2, 3, 4, 9
1 = 3, 5, 6, 7, 8

3,5,finale(notslow) = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

during finale, after slow phase, all attack lengths decrease by "10"
- except flamethrower, which stays the same
